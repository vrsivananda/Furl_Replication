                        Thank you for your interest in this study!  If you so choose, you will be participating in a study conducted by principal investigator Dr. Hakwan Lau (UCLA). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this study is to investigate how effectively you can report things you have seen.
                    </p>
                    <p>The experiment displays images at various locations in your browser window. Before we describe the task and instructions below, please note the following four items:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>(1) PLEASE USE GOOGLE CHROME AS YOUR WEB BROWSER IN THIS EXPERIMENT.</b>
                        <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers will not work.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>(2) Please resize this browser window NOW so that it fills your entire screen!</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>(3) Please do NOT adjust your browser size after starting the experiment, as this can disrupt proper presentation of the stimuli.</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>(4) Finally, please note that it may take the experiment a few seconds to load!</b> You do not need to refresh the page after clicking the button to begin; the screen will change and the experiment will start after a few seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Task:</b>
                        <br>
                        If you elect to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following task: on every trial, shapes or images in different locations will be shown as stimuli. Following the presentation of the stimuli, you will be asked to judge various attributes of the stimuli or compare them with each other, and rate confidence in your answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	Then, you will be asked to take a 21-question online questionnaire designed to measure beliefs and vivid mental experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire study should last between 30 and 60 minutes. It is important that you complete the study while in a quiet place where you can focus without distraction.  Please be sure that you have enough time and are in an appropriate setting before continuing with the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As with any task requiring you to focus intently on the computer monitor, you may experience some eye fatigue or dryness. Although there will be no breaks during trials, you are encouraged to take short 1-minute breaks every 10 minutes between trials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Eligibility:</b>
                        <br>
                        In order to participate, you must be using a computer (this should not be done on a mobile device or iPad), be using Google Chrome as your web browser (Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. will not work), and must have normal or corrected-to-normal vision (glasses or contacts are ok! Just make sure you are wearing them when you participate in this study).  Please DO NOT participate if you have a history of seizures, epilepsy, or stroke, as the stimuli we present 
                        in the experiment will be briefly flashed, and this is a potential (but unlikely) seizure trigger. Finally, if you have previously participated in an experiment about judging images that looks similar to this one, we would appreciate it if you abstained from participating, as we would like to evaluate participants that have never done this task before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Risks:</b>
                        <br>
                        Some of the questions on the questionnaire may be upsetting, or you may feel uncomfortable answering them. If you do not wish to answer a question, you can skip it and go to the next question.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Compensation:</b>
                        <br>
                        You will be compensated $4 per hour for completion of the study, Thus, if the study lasts 30 minutes, you will be compensation $2 for your participation. There is a possibility of receiving a $1 bonus if your performance is higher than that of the previous participant. Thus, if you complete the 30-minute study and earn the bonus payment, you will receive $3 for your participation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You may choose to withdraw from the experiment at any point, and we also reserve the right to terminate your session at any time. Should you choose to withdraw (or should your session be terminated), you will be paid for the total amount of time you participated, up to one hour, at a rate of $4/hr. For example, if you participated for 15 minutes and then stopped, you would be paid $1 for participating. Note, however, that if you withdraw, or if your session is terminated, you will not be eligible for the bonus payment. Additionally, you will need to email UCRneuralcomputation@gmail.com, notifying the experimenters of when you participated (please include the day and time in the email) so you can be manually compensated through the mTurk system. We will not pay beyond 60 minutes of participation, as this experiment should be completed in 60 minutes or less.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You will not directly benefit from your participation in the research study, other than contributing to psychological research.
